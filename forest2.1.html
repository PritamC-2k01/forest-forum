                    Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, also known as Sasan-Gir, is a wildlife sanctuary and protected forest area in Gujarat, India. It is considered one of the most important protected natural areas in Asia due to the rare animals living here, particularly the pure Asiatic Lions (Panthera leo persica).
                  </p>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>The sanctuary lies in the peninsula of Gujarat that is India's south-western part with terrain that has low hills, is rugged and filled with mixed deciduous trees.

<p>In the 19th century, the rulers of Indian princely states used to invite the British colonists for hunting expeditions. 
    At the end of the 19th century, only about a dozen Asiatic lions were left in India, all of them in the Gir Forest, which was part of the Nawab of Junagarh's private hunting grounds.
     British viceroys brought the drastic decline of the lion population in Gir to the attention of the Nawab of Junagadh, who established the sanctuary.
      
</p>  
<p>Today, it is the only area in Asia where Asiatic lions occur and is considered one of the most important protected areas in Asia because of its biodiversity.
    The Gir ecosystem with its diverse flora and fauna is protected as a result of the efforts of the government forest department, wildlife activists and NGOs. 
    It is now considered the jewel of Gujarat's ecological resources.</p>
